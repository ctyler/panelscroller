# panelscroller
Python software to scroll messages on an 8x32 WS2812 matrix controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero W

This software was used to display messages
on a flexible panel attached with hook-and-loop
fasteners to a t-shirt, worn underneath a top
shirt. The Pi Zero W can be carried in a pocket,
powered by batteries (important: allow for
sufficient current for the LED panel!). The Pi
GPIO 18 pin is used to send data to the WS2812
matrix.

Lots of room for embelishment: wifi/bluetooth
control from a cellphone, automatic displays of
tweets, and so forth. And of course, more colour!
